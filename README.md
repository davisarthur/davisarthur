- 👋 Hi, I’m @davisarthur
- I graduated in December 2022 from the University of Florida with a Master's in Computer Science 🐊
- At UF, I primarily focused on machine learning and computer graphics. Check out my most recent machine learning and computer graphics projects in my pinned repos.
- Previously, I've contributed to several research projects centered around quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
My BalancedClustering repository is an open source implementation of a quantum clustering algorithm I designed for the D-Wave 2000Q quantum computer.
